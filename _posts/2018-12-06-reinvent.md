We've been using Elasticsearch at [Sportsengine](https://www.sportsengine.com) for quite some time. This year, I had the unique opportunity to give a talk with Senior Platform Operations Manager [Andy Fleener](https://twitter.com/andy.fleener) at Amazon's annual AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. Our presentation covers the application and underlying architecture of SportsEngine HQ. Specifically Directory, Powerpay, and Rostering - which is based on Amazon's Elasticsearch Service. AWS re:Invent is an annual 5-day event which hosted over 50,000 attendees this year. More than 880 total people attended our talk, which has been made available on YouTube:
