I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) working on solving Serverless monitoring and observability! Before that, I was Principal Software Engineer at [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) where I helped build Serverless Enterprise; a product dedicated to helping organizations develop, deploy, secure, and monitor their Serverless applications.

When I'm not writing software, you can find me [Base Jumping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkZFH1OaqOA) in the [red-dirt canyons of Utah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s-nHJUCmrQ), or the [edge of a cliff near the Alps - gearing up with my wingsuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MMXDcrpxQE).

I was born in Neenah, Wisconsin. I studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota (BS - 2013).

I live in Northeast Minneapolis, Minnesota.
