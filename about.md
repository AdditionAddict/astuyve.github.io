I'm a Lead Software Engineer at [SportsEngine](https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions) where I build web and mobile applications to help coaches, volunteers, and administrators spend less time in their offices and more time on the field.

When I'm not writing software, you can find me [Base Jumping](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiW8qCRh1IA/?taken-by=aj.stuyv) in the [red-dirt canyons of Utah](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb-VyUdAfs1/), or the [edge of a cliff near the Alps - gearing up with my wingsuit](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPQCe4uA1l3/?taken-by=aj.stuyv).

I was born in Neenah, Wisconsin. I studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota (BS - 2013).

I live in Northeast Minneapolis, Minnesota.
