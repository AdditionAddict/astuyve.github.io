## Ready, Set, Cloud!
#### March 24, 2023
<p>I sat down with AWS Serverless Hero [Allen Helton](https://www.readysetcloud.io/) to help answer the question: "Why is Serverless Observability so hard?". We covered a range of topics including continuous profilers, distributed tracing, and how to monitor end to end latency in data pipelines.</p>

<blockquote>
Serverless is taking the world by storm. Despite there being countless blogs, tutorials, and recommended best practices around serverless, there’s shockingly little material on observability. Why? It’s hard! Join AJ and Allen as they talk about the difficulties of observing a serverless application, dive into the differences between KPIs and infrastructure metrics, what the future holds for observability, and more.

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/reinvent.jpg"></span>We've been using Elasticsearch at [Sportsengine](https://www.sportsengine.com) for quite some time. This year, I had the unique opportunity to give a talk with Senior Platform Operations Manager [Andy Fleener](https://twitter.com/andy.fleener) at Amazon's annual AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. Our presentation covers the application and underlying architecture of SportsEngine HQ. Specifically Directory, Powerpay, and Rostering - which is based on Amazon's Elasticsearch Service. AWS re:Invent is an annual 5-day event which hosted over 50,000 attendees this year. More than 880 total people attended our talk, which has been made available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/95kQkS51VnU">YouTube</a>
